Complete the application
Your lender will assist you to fill out a loan application.

Get preapproved
After reviewing your completed loan application, the lender can give you a preapproval letter, a written letter that confirms the price of home you can purchase.

Processing
Your home mortgage specialist collects the necessary financial documents to process your loan. The property is appraised to determine its fair market value.

Receiving approval
The lender will review your application and financial information to make their lending decision. If your application is declined, they may recommend steps you can take in order to obtain financing.

Pre-closing
In this phase, sometimes referred to as “loan settlement,” your home mortgage consultant will work with you to secure any required title insurance and real estate documents to protect against other parties claiming ownership of the property.

Closing
The day and time when all final mortgage documents are signed and all necessary payments are transferred to complete the purchase of a house. Also known as the settlement date.

Loan servicing
The steps taken to maintain a loan from the time it’s closed until it’s paid off, for example billing the borrower, collecting payments, and making contract changes. It’s not uncommon to have loan servicing transferred between many companies during the life of a loan.
