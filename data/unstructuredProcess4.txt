Heat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.
Line two 18cm/7in cake tins with baking parchment
Cream the butter and the sugar together until pale. Use an electric hand mixer if you have one.
Beat in the eggs.
Sift over the flour and fold in using a large metal spoon.
The mixture should be of a dropping consistency; if it is not, add a little milk.
Divide the mixture between the cake tins and gently spread out with a spatula. Bake for 20-25 minutes until an inserted skewer comes out clean. Allow to stand for 5 minutes before turning on to a wire rack to cool.
Sandwich the cakes together with jam, lemon curd or whipped cream and berries or just enjoy on its own.
